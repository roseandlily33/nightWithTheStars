Mini Movie Project 

## Description
Using the TMDB API, I wanted to create a mini movie project to display skills.
Based on some of the starter code on codecademy to fetch and get the api information, but I took it afterwards and made it my own. Styling, colours, and fonts were all picked and designed by me. 

## Motivation
Based on the idea from a group project, and stumbling across it on codecademy on my own I decided that it looked like a really fun project to take on and make it my own.

## Usage
I'm not going to post it, because that would expose 
my API key, but if you would like to try it for yourself, clone it, make an account on tmdb for your own apikey and just add it to the apikey place on the top of the javascript. 

## Technologies and methods used:
-JSON, Fetch
-Await/Async, Try/Catch
-Modular Code
-.gitignore
-Web API's
-Server Side API's 

## What I learned:
Things that I learned was some major debgugging, passing the fetched information through different functions,
